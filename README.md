Zombie Project
==============

A class project for my Introduction to Software Engineering class.

This site integrates with the Zombie Attack Game built by github user numso (see http://zombie-attack.aws.af.cm/ for more info).

This site was built on a Django backend and uses Backbone.js on the frontend.
